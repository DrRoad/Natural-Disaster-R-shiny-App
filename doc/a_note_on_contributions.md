Project 2: ** The Natural Disaster Navigator **

Team members: Yiran Li, Hongjie Ren, Hongyang Yang, Siyi Wang, Yina Wei

Summary: In this project, we developed an RShiny App that aims at processing and visualizing natural disaster data, allowing users from high-risk area residents to government officials to explore and extract meaningful insights from disaster data sets in order to minimize costs and optimize resource allocation in the face of natural disasters.

[Contribution Statement] 
  + Yiran Li organized group meetings, booked venues for meetings, facilitated discussions, delegated tasks to teammates, obtained, combined and cleaned various data sets (including number of natural disasters and population by state and by year) from Data.gov, US Census Bureau, and FEMA, plotted two interactive Google Charts and a motion chart for summary statistics, edited README.md, debugged, modified and merged teammates' code, and presented the project in class.
  
  + Hongyang Yang obtained detailed natural disaster data from data.gov; combined, cleaned, and preprocessed 4 years data (208,739 obs, 14 variables); designed and developed the interactive map to monitor different type of disasters by state and month; helped Hongjie developed the Heatmap,use rgdal convert json file to SpatialPolygons file to avoid libjq error; updated data and readme files,combined the interactive map and heat map server and ui, deployed the final shiny app.
   
  + Hongjie Ren designed and developed the Heat map for injuries and deaths by each state; helped Hongyang figure out how to add colors and legend to the interactive map.

  + Siyi Wang
  
 Â + Yina Wei gathered and classfied data from database (including processing data to build column that indicates the ages of dead people from different disaster in different states from 2010 to 2017), plotted two Google Charts to describe the relationship between the age and disaster and conducted analysis on the natural disasters; Finally uploaded the codes and results to the team leader: Yiran Li.
