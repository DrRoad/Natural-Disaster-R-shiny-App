Project 2: ** The Natural Disaster Navigator **

Team members: Yiran Li, Hongjie Ren, Hongyang Yang, Siyi Wang, Yina Wei

Summary: In this project, we developed an RShiny App that aims at processing and visualizing natural disaster data, allowing users from high-risk area residents to government officials to explore and extract meaningful insights from disaster data sets in order to minimize costs and optimize resource allocation in the face natural disasters.
